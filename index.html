    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Benjamin is a multidisciplinary designer who is able to enter a myriad of spaces to creatively solve problems. He goes about under the alias Benji, and you will find him working comfortably within a team operating in an agile & scrum project management environment. He was previously trained in Landscape Architecture and had work experiences in the Built Environment industry in various disciplines before embarking on his education in Industrial Design. He is presently working as a UX Designer in NCS Group with a long-term career goal of assuming a Lead Product Designer eventually as he gathers further work experiences. Design to him will always be exciting because he is constantly learning new things and technologies which broadens his perspectives. What keeps him going at work is in knowing the impact on livelihoods of people that he would be able to bring value to through the form of products and services.</p></td>
